# go.bat
DOS script providing shortcuts to directories I use a lot.

**Usage: go [shortcut]**

To add a new shortcut, make a new if statement under :init and make a new block using the label and end it with 'goto end'.

I'm using this to run cd commands, but any DOS command will do. Just remember to have this file somewhere in the default paths.

*Update:*
I really don't use those directories any more, but the script is provided here as an example of how to make simple alias functions in a DOS batch script.
