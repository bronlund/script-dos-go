Shortcuts to directories I use a lot.

**Usage: go [shortcut]**

To add a new shortcut, make a new if statement under :init and
make a new block using the label and end it with 'goto end'.

I'm using this to run cd commands, but any DOS command will do.
Just remember to have this file somewhere in the default paths.
